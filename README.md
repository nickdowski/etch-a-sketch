# 🎨 Etch-A-Sketch: JavaScript Edition 🕹️

Welcome to the *coolest drawing tool* that absolutely **no one** asked for — but you're gonna love it anyway. This is a digital Etch-A-Sketch made with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No knobs. No batteries. Just code, baby.

## 💡 What is this?
A grid of squares that turns black when you hover over them. That's it.

Except there's also a **magic button** that lets you:
- Blow up the current grid 🎇
- Ask how many squares per side you want 🧮
- Then regenerates a *perfectly sized* new grid inside a cozy 600×600 box 🧼

You're basically a pixel wizard.

## 🔧 How it works

- Hover over squares: 💀 They turn black. No forgiveness.
- Click “Reset”: 📦 You're prompted to enter a number (1–100) for grid size.
- JavaScript does its magic 🧙 and rebuilds the grid accordingly.

- `style.css` – Makes it look like someone actually cared.
